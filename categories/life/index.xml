      <description>This last Wednesday I had the honor of attending a luncheon with ODU&amp;rsquo;s current president John R. Broderick. This event was a meetup with the local Tau Beta Pi engineering honor society chapter.
The food was delicious! We were able to talk to Broderick about current events on campus, and suggestions we had (especially with regard to on-campus parking).
